Running instruction:
        oominimax.py can be run in the terminal using the commands:
            python3 oominimax
        The program will ask the user to choose between X or O to plat tic tac toe
        After the program will ask if the user wants to start first.
        The user will have to use the NUMPAD from 1-9 to place X/O on the grid.
        The corresponding NUMPAD keys on the board are:
        |1|2|3|
        |4|5|6|
        |7|8|9|
        

Notes and assumption:
        oominimax.py is mostly cut and pasted from minimax.py to fit the
        weekly exeercise #6 specification.
        minimax.py was written by Clederson Cruz, year 2017. Modified by Paul Lu.

        What I changed from the original minimax.py is to create a class State, and class Turns.
        In class State, I added the following method: def __init__(self), def __str__(self), def get_board(self),
                                                      def __repr__(self), def set_board(self, x, y, player).

        In class Turns, I added the following method: def __init__(self), def __str__(self), def __repr__(self).
